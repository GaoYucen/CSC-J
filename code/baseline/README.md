`algorithm.py`: the main implementation of the algorithms
`csc.py`: comparison of four algorithms: CoCycle, OSweep, MinExpand, and PDBA. Gives their minimum sweep periods and the routes taken.
`mssc.py`: irrelevant for now

Run: directly run `csc.py`

Requirements: `points.csv` be under the same working directory
